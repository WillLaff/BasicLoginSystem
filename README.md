# Basic Login System

## How it works

This program will start by asking whether you want to register or sign in. 

If you do not have not registered an account, select the first choice. Then enter the username and password that you desire. (side note: password is not hidden!)

If you have registered an account, select option 2. Enter the username and password for the accout, and you will be signed in.
